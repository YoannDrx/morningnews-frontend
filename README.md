#  📚 Morning News

Hi,
I'm Yoann, I'm currently deepening my knowledge in web development. I'm specialized in React frontend development.
I had fun coding all these projects!
Feel free to ask me questions and don't hesitate to look at my other projects ;)
Have fun coding!

## ✍️ Description 

Morning News is a web application that displays recent news from The Verge. The app is built using React and includes features such as navigation, Redux, and authentication. (API : [https://newsapi.org/](https://newsapi.org/) ) 

In Part 1, the application's base is already set up, and the task is to add navigation and populate the application with real news using NewsAPI.

In Part 2, users can save favorite articles to the "Bookmarks" tab using Redux.

In Part 3, users can create an account, log in, and log out. The HTML structure and style are already in place, and routes must be set up to connect to the database. Redux is used to share login information across the entire application.

In Part 4, security is improved by adding a token and hashing the user's password. Unauthorized users are blocked from using the "Bookmarks" feature.

In Part 5, the focus is on improving user experience by making the store persistent. This means that users can stay logged in and keep their favorite articles even when refreshing the page. A feature will also be added to allow users to hide articles they have already read.
